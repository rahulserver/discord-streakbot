This is a bot for maintaining streaks and other admin related functions. All the commands are in the `commands/` directory.

For making this work, you need to first replace this line in `index.js` with your bot token:

`const bot_secret_token = "SOME_TOKEN";`

And then follow steps as usual to deploy this.
